      <h3>LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.</h3>
      <p>  My name is Shubham Karmokar. Iâ€™m a frontend software engineer  in Mumbai


My work currently consists of a full time engineering role at Tata Consultancy Services . I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning as a web developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks, etc.

My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress & Shopify, of which I'm self taught. In 2017, I started at UCLA to broaden my knowledge of the Node.js ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with & have been primarily using React & Redux in web applications. For static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast, SEO-driven headless frontend user interfaces.

Whether you're a business owner looking to get started on a app or web development project with a freelance web developer, a developer looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi, shoot me a message and let's work together.</p>
